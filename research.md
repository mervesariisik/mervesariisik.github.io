**Voluntary Disclosure under Salary History Ban: A Model and an Experimental Investigation** *(Job Market Paper)*

Several states and cities have recently adopted Salary History Bans (SHB) that prohibit prospective employers from asking about applicants’ salary histories. The goal of such bans is to disrupt the history dependence in wage setting to alleviate race and gender wage gap. However, given the productivity signaling value of past salary, it is natural to expect voluntary disclosure by applicants. How will SHB impact employers’ inference under wage gap? We use a theoretical model to reflect employer naivete in interpreting past salary information or the lack thereof. Consider a sender who aims at inflating receiver’s estimate, who may choose to disclose a signal that is a biased representation her true type. We represent wage gap through two different sender groups with disproportionate endowment of either lower (”disadvantaged”) or higher signals (”advantaged”). Both theory and experimental data suggest that receivers under(over)estimate types when disclosed signals are low(high) for the disadvantaged(advantaged) group. We further find that such over/underestimation of disclosed signals is greater under voluntary disclosure. Theory further predicts that receivers will overestimate types when signals are not disclosed. Overall, our results suggest that SHB can hurt and benefit the applicants who come from the disadvantaged and the advantaged group respectively.

**Identity Discrimination in the Sharing Economy: A Field Experiment**

The number of online marketplaces and sharing economy platforms are rapidly increasing. Although the online nature provides an opportunity to improve over offline markets, certain design choices can still lead to undesired outcomes. We conduct a field experiment and combine the results with web scraped data to investigate discriminatory consequences of a trust-based design. We find nine percentage point gap between the acceptance rate of requests from guests with distinctively Arab/Muslim identities and that of distinctively non-Arab/Muslim identities. The difference persists across different specifications. Adding to the literature of similar papers on discrimination in the sharing economy platforms such as Edelman, Luca and Svirksy 2016, our results emphasize the need for careful restructuring of the such platforms’ market design.

## Working Paper

**Bargaining under Salary History Ban: An Experiment**

This paper explores the impacts of SHB on bargaining through a frequent interaction experiment where bargaining is dynamic, there is private information and a noisy signal (i.e. salary) available to informed parties. The design lets us analyze salary disclosure behavior, test the mechanism design predictions and come up with best predictors of higher financial gains for the informed party.
